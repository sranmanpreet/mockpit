# Mockpit - Dynamic REST API Mock Server

Mockpit is a versatile and user-friendly REST API mock server that empowers developers to create and manage mock APIs effortlessly. With Mockpit, you can dynamically generate response bodies, leverage path variables and query parameters, and define custom response headers to simulate a wide range of API behaviors. Whether you're testing your frontend application, developing a new feature, or need a temporary API for your project, Mockpit has you covered.
